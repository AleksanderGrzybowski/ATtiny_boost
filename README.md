I salvaged a 12V fan from old, broken power supply. This project is software boost converter combined with fan PWM controller, that is powered from USB port. Inductor switching frequency is around 30 kHz, max output current for stable 12V output is around 180 mA (this fan needs 60 mA). Efficiency is bad, around 60%, hey, no surprises here.
